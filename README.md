* the best way to build this project is with the Arduino IDE available here: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
* this project uses two libraries
 * for controlling the RGB LEDs: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel
 * for reading the rotary encoder: http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Encoder.html
* suggested parts list from Adafruit

| Part          | Price | Notes |                                      
|---------------|-------|-------|
| [arduino_uno_starter_kit](https://www.adafruit.com/products/193) | $34.95 | Has a few extra parts but overall a great deal |
| [rotary_encoder](https://www.adafruit.com/products/377) | $4.50 | Includes a plastic knob |
| [1m_led_strip](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1460) | $16.95 | This may or may not have the JST connector on the end. If not, just solder 3 wires (or a 3 pin JST socket connector) directly onto the strip. The longer 5m strip will definitely have a connector |

| [redboard_with_arduino](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12757) | $19.95 | | 
| [jumper_wires](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12795) | $1.95 | | 
| [rotary_encoder_with_rgb](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10982) | $4.95 | The pinout is different on this encoder. Just ordered one and will post an update video when i get a chance to try it out. | 
| [knob_for_encoder](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10597)      | $0.95 | | 
| [1m_led_strip](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14015)          | $15.95 | this has 60 leds instead of 30 |
