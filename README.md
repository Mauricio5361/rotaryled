* the best way to build this project is with the Arduino IDE available here: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
* this project uses two libraries
 * for controlling the RGB LEDs: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel
 * for reading the rotary encoder: http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Encoder.html

| Part | Price | Notes |                                      
|------|-------|-------|
| [arduino uno starter kit](https://www.adafruit.com/products/193) | 34.95 | Has a few extra parts but overall a great deal |
| [rotary encoder](https://www.adafruit.com/products/377) | 4.50 | Includes a plastic knob |
| [1m led strip](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1460) | 16.95 | This may or may not have the JST connector on the end. If not, just solder 3 wires (or a 3 pin JST socket connector) directly onto the strip. The longer 5m strip will definitely have a connector |
